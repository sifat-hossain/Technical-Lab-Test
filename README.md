# Technical-Lab-Test
1. I have put some demo data for testing. execute these query in your sql server i) exec "SpInsertDataIntoBuilding"
                                                                                 ii) exec "SpInsertDataIntoDataField"
                                                                                 iii) exec "SpInsertDataIntoObject" . 
2. exec "SpInsertDataIntoReadingTable"  ---- this query will insert 1051200000 data in reading table
3. i have created API for retriving the data. Backend is completed according to your requirments. if you run the system then you can see the data in browser.
4. as i was not work with angular before, so i couldnot complete the frontend part. it may takes some more times for me.
5. I hope you will accept the coding Structure
